Problem:
The input is given as two arrays containing integers. Both the arrays are sorted. The desired output is a sorted array of elements from both the input arrays. The input arrays are of size x and 2x respectively. Both arrays have x sorted integers and the larger array has x number of zeroes padded in the end. Minimize the space complexity of the solution. Do not use additional arrays to hold data.

Solution:
This question is implying an in-place merge function as in the merge-sort sorting algorithm with constant space complexity.
